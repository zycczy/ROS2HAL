Changelog for package image_proc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

6.0.8 (2025-02-10)
------------------
* Removed warning (`#1063 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/1063>`_)
* Contributors: Alejandro Hernández Cordero

6.0.7 (2024-12-27)
------------------

6.0.6 (2024-12-11)
------------------

6.0.5 (2024-10-30)
------------------
* Use TF2 package for quaternion conversion (`#1031 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/1031>`_)
  The OpenCV quaternion class was not added until OpenCV 4.5.1, so it's
  less widely available than the TF2 conversion. This change allows a
  source build of the ROS 2 "perception" variant on Ubuntu 20.04 without a
  custom source build of OpenCV.
  Addresses issue
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/1030
* Contributors: Ted Steiner

6.0.4 (2024-10-16)
------------------

6.0.3 (2024-08-20)
------------------
* Publish using unique ptr (`#1016 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/1016>`_)
  Prevents doing an extra copy of the data when using intra-process
  communication.
* Finish QoS updates (`#1019 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/1019>`_)
  This implements the remainder of `#847 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/847>`_:
  - Make sure publishers default to system defaults (reliable)
  - Add QoS overriding where possible (some of the image_transport /
  message_filters stuff doesn't really support that)
  - Use the matching heuristic for subscribers consistently
* Updated deprecated rcpputils::path (`#1014 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/1014>`_)
* Contributors: Alejandro Hernández Cordero, Błażej Sowa, Michael Ferguson

6.0.2 (2024-07-23)
------------------

6.0.1 (2024-07-22)
------------------

6.0.0 (2024-05-27)
------------------

5.0.1 (2024-03-26)
------------------
* Fix parameter names in components.rst (`#959 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/959>`_)
  In the docs for `image_proc::CropDecimateNode` , change the parameter
  names `x_offset` and `y_offset` to `offset_x` and `offset_y`, matching
  the actual names of parameters defined in crop_decimate.cpp
* fix image publisher remapping (`#941 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/941>`_)
  Addresses `#940 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/940>`_ - fixes the compressed/etc topic remapping for publishers
* unified changelog, add missing image, deduplicate tutorials (`#938 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/938>`_)
  Last bit of documentation updates - putting together a single changelog
  summary for the whole release (rather than scattering among packages).
  Unified the camera_info tutorial so it isn't duplicated. Added a missing
  image from image_rotate (was on local disk, but hadn't committed it)
* Add TrackMarkerNode to image_proc (`#930 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/930>`_)
  Converts sensors_msgs/Image into geometry_msg/PoseStamped using OpenCV Aruco marker detection.
* migrate image_pipeline docs (`#929 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/929>`_)
  * Migrates image_pipeline overview page
  * Migrates CameraInfo wiki page
  * Adds links to the other packages in this stack
  * Updates depth_image_proc and image_proc to have the overview page properly named and in the TOC
* migrate depth_image_proc docs (`#926 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/926>`_)
* fixup bash command rendering (`#927 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/927>`_)
  I didn't actually rebuild with the suggestions in `#925 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/925>`_ - but this is
  actually proper rendering (even my three-ticks version wasn't quite
  pretty)
* migrate and update image_proc docs (`#925 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/925>`_)
  * move component documentation from ros wiki, update for various changes
  * add tutorial on how to run components
  * update tutorial on debayer/rectify to use launch file
  * remove image_proc node, it has always been completely broken and the
  launch file has the same (but working) functionality
  * update launch file to support namespace parameter for tutorial
* QoS improvements for image_proc and stereo_image_proc (`#922 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/922>`_)
  First part of `#847 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/847>`_
  * Add QoS overrides for all publishers (in the new, standard way)
  * stereo_image_proc: Default subscriber QoS to SensorDataQoS
  * Clean up some of the comments around lazy subscribers, make them more
  consistent across nodes
* Contributors: Michael Ferguson, Noah Mollerstuen

5.0.0 (2024-01-24)
------------------
* Port image_proc test to ROS 2 (`#910 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/910>`_)
* Removed cfg files related with ROS 1 parameters (`#911 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/911>`_)
  Removed cfg files related with ROS 1 parameters
* image_proc: consistent image_transport (`#884 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/884>`_)
  * consistent image_transport parameter for crop_decimate, crop_non_zero
  and debayer nodes
  * consistent remapping support for compressed/etc topics in all three
  nodes
  * add lazy subscription support to crop_non_zero
  Additional minor fixes:
  * put the getTopicQosProfile() for publisher right in front of publisher
  declaration for clarity
* resize/recify: consistent image_transport (`#883 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/883>`_)
  * support image_transport parameter
  * proper renaming so compressed/etc topics work as expected
  Additional minor fixes:
  * rename interpolation -> interpolation\_ for consistency
  * move parameter declaration BEFORE we create a publisher (and possibly
  get a subscriber created in connect callback)
  * put the getTopicQosProfile() for publisher right in front of publisher
  declaration for clarity
* ROS 2: Merged resize.cpp: fix memory leak (`#874 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/874>`_)
  Related with this PR in ROS 1
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/pull/489
* allow use as component or node (`#852 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/852>`_)
  This addresses
  https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/823:
  * depth_image_proc was never implemented properly this way
  * image_proc might have once worked this way, but it appears upstream
  has changed over time and it was no longer doing the job.
  * stereo_image_proc is actually implemented correctly - I just added a
  comment

  * Connect/disconnect callbacks, per https://github.com/ros2/rmw/issues/330 (this made it into Iron)
  * Updated APIs in https://github.com/ros-perception/image_common/pull/272 (this is only in Rolling currently)
* add myself as a maintainer (`#846 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/846>`_)
